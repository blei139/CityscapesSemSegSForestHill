by Udacity's self-driving car curriculum, the road is painted well in most cases.

On 11/16/17, after 8 days of another round of training, the entropy loss has reduced from 0.6 to 0.433. From the augmented images that I generated, the road classification shows improvements. I will generated more videos to see the results tonight.

In the mean time, third round of training is starting, too.
